Welcome to my school community project
Here is the link to the website:https://justaintremblay.azurewebsites.net/(Note: this is hosted in azure with my student account so it may not be available in the future)

This project does many things however, the quick overview is:
A table of students and a table of communities(think of a club) that lets you add students to multiple clubs as well as add advertisement images to the clubs.
The goal of this project was more backend focused so looking through the code would be a good idea.

Room for improvement(either issues or weak points):
A Home page that's a bit more fleshed out.
More comments in the code
